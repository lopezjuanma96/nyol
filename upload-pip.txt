Following this: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-de1b363a1b3

- update setup.py version
- cd to pynyol
- run "python setup.py sdist"
- optional: check the changes appear correclty on the tar file generated under dist for the new version
- run "twine upload dist/*" (if twine not available install with pip "pip install twine")

for testing, create a specific environment and inside the pynyol folder (not nyol/pynyol/pynyol, just nyol/pynyol) run "pip install -e ." which install pynyol locally with the source data from that folder
